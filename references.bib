With the advances in computer vision and deep learning, the study of Indonesian local character recognition still has room for improvement and therefore needs to be encouraged. In this study, the Sundanese script used was Swara and Ngalagena script. The classification of the Sundanese script poses a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of the script's visual patterns. Therefore, this study classifies Sundanese script using the deep learning method, namely the Transfer Learning method based on the Convolutional Neural Network. The architectures used in this research are ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNet. Then to evaluate the performance of the three architectures, the evaluation metrics used in this study are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-scores will be used. The three CNN architectures show very satisfactory results in classifying Sundanese scripts. VGG-19 architecture Accuracy is 99% for training data and 95% for validation data, the ResNet-50 architecture is 97%, and for validation data is 91%. Meanwhile, the MobileNet architecture data train produces an Accuracy of 97% and data validation of 92%. Overall. The VGG-19 architecture is the best in this Sundanese script classification study.},

   abstract = {Recognizing the handwritten Sundanese script holds significant importance in the preservation of Indonesian regional scripts. While traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods have been utilized, deep learning approaches have shown promise in enhancing handwritten character recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a prominent choice due to their efficacy in computer vision tasks. Various CNN architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results in handwritten character recognition. However, selecting activation functions remains a crucial aspect influencing CNN performance. Despite extensive research on activation functions in handwritten character recognition, there exists a gap in understanding which activation functions are optimal for training models specifically tailored to handwritten Sundanese script recognition. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the efficacy of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, including Leaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU (RLReLU), and Optimized Leaky ReLU (OLReLU). In training Sundanese script OCR models, the utilization of OLReLU surpasses other activation functions. While OLReLU marginally lags behind RLReLU quantitatively on validation data, OLReLU maintains its qualitative superiority among other functions on test data, achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9875. This comparative analysis underscores the efficacy of OLReLU in the context of handwritten Sundanese script recognition, offering valuable insights for the development of robust OCR systems tailored to this regional script.},

Image is visual information, but not all images are of good quality. Sometimes there is noise that can damage the information in it. Therefore, this research improves image quality on Sundanese handwritten image data using the Arithmetic Mean Filter and Gaussian Filter methods to be classified using the Support Vector Machine method. The Arithmetic Mean Filter and Gaussian Filter methods effectively improve image quality. We can also see this from data classification results before and after improving image quality. Noise data on Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, and spackle noise before being improved gets an accuracy value of 19%, 54%, and 52%. After being improved using the Gaussian Filter method, the accuracy value increases by 52%, 56%, and 70%. Meanwhile, using the Arithmetic Mean Filter method, the accuracy value increases by 59%, 65%, and 74%.

In this regard, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifier to recognize the ancient Sundanese characters obtained from a digital collection of Southeast Asian palm leaf manuscripts. In this work, we utilize two different preprocessing techniques for the dataset. The first technique involves the use of geometric transformations, noise background addition, and brightness adjustment to augment the imbalanced samples to be fed into the classifier. The second technique makes use of the Otsu's threshold method to binarize the characters and only uses the usual geometric transformations for the data augmentation. The proposed network with different data augmentation processes is trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. Image binarization from the second technique can outperform the performance of the CNN-based classifier upon the first technique by achieving a testing accuracy of 97.74%.},

   abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

To develop these models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose an improved method of progressive learning, which adaptively adjusts regularization (e.g. data augmentation) along with image size. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on Im-ageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our Effi-cientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

The CNN has superior features for autonomous learning and expression, and feature extraction from original input data can be realized by means of training CNN models that match practical applications. Due to the rapid progress in deep learning technology, the structure of CNN is becoming more and more complex and diverse. Consequently, it gradually replaces the traditional machine learning methods. This paper presents an elementary understanding of CNN components and their functions, including input layers, convolution layers, pooling layers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, fully connected layers, and output layers. On this basis, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of the past and current research status of the applications of CNN models in computer vision fields, e.g., image classification, object detection, and video prediction. In addition, we summarize the challenges and solutions of the deep CNN, and future research directions are also discussed.</p>},

We leverage recent advances of deep convo-lutional neural networks to generate an ordered high-level sequence from a whole word image, avoiding the difficult character segmentation problem. Then a deep recurrent model, building on long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to robustly recognize the generated CNN sequences, departing from most existing approaches recognising each character independently. Our model has a number of appealing properties in comparison to existing scene text recognition methods: (i) It can recognise highly ambiguous words by leverag-ing meaningful context information, allowing it to work reliably without either pre-or post-processing; (ii) the deep CNN feature is robust to various image distortions; (iii) it retains the explicit order information in word image , which is essential to discriminate word strings; (iv) the model does not depend on pre-defined dictionary, and it can process unknown words and arbitrary strings. It achieves impressive results on several benchmarks, advancing the-state-of-the-art substantially.

In order to assess the performance of our OCR, the proposed system is performed on two printed text datasets which are P-KHATT (text line images) and APTI (word images). It's also evaluated on a handwritten Arabic text dataset IFN/ENIT (word images). According to the practical tests, the conceived model achieves strength recognition rates on the three datasets. ADOCRNet reaches a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.01% on the P-KHATT dataset, 0.03% on the APTI dataset and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.09% on the IFN/ENIT dataset, which significantly outperforms the outcomes of the current systems.},

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has conventionally fulfilled this role. With surging mobile phone usage, leveraging text detection via mobile cameras gains significance in fields like medical script processing and exam evaluation. To enhance image quality, noise reduction techniques like binarization and thresholding are applied. Image processing entails letter segmentation and extraction. In this paper, we propose a neural network classifier model amalgamating Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Leveraging an existing feature dataset, the model is trained. Input images are evaluated through the neural network, yielding recognized words in a text document format. Ultimately, the predicted output is derived via Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)- based loss computation.

   abstract = {Deep learning, a crucial technique for achieving artificial intelligence (AI), has been successfully applied in many fields. The gradual application of the latest architectures of deep learning in the field of time series forecasting (TSF), such as Transformers, has shown excellent performance and results compared to traditional statistical methods. These applications are widely present in academia and in our daily lives, covering many areas including forecasting electricity consumption in power systems, meteorological rainfall, traffic flow, quantitative trading, risk control in finance, sales operations and price predictions for commercial companies, and pandemic prediction in the medical field. Deep learning-based TSF tasks stand out as one of the most valuable AI scenarios for research, playing an important role in explaining complex real-world phenomena. However, deep learning models still face challenges: they need to deal with the challenge of large-scale data in the information age, achieve longer forecasting ranges, reduce excessively high computational complexity, etc. Therefore, novel methods and more effective solutions are essential. In this paper, we review the latest developments in deep learning for TSF. We begin by introducing the recent development trends in the field of TSF and then propose a new taxonomy from the perspective of deep neural network models, comprehensively covering articles published over the past five years. We also organize commonly used experimental evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, we point out current issues with the existing solutions and suggest promising future directions in the field of deep learning combined with TSF. This paper is the most comprehensive review related to TSF in recent years and will provide a detailed index for researchers in this field and those who are just starting out.},

   abstract = {Optical character recognition (OCR) for Arabic presents unique challenges due to the script's cursive nature, contextual letter forms, multiple ligatures, the presence of diacritics, and the high variability in handwritten styles. This work introduces an enhanced Arabic handwritten word recognition architecture that integrates the attention mechanism (AM) into an end-to-end framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNN), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and connectionist temporal classification (CTC), while utilizing word beam search (WBS) for decoding. To address the issue of imbalanced data in the IFN/ENIT dataset, an adaptive data augmentation algorithm is proposed, focusing on underrepresented characters and words. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple train-test configurations compare the model's performance with and without attention, employing the original dataset, standard augmentation, and the proposed adaptive augmentation method. Results demonstrate that incorporating attention significantly enhances the character accuracy rate (CAR) and word accuracy rate (WAR), with further improvements observed when using adaptive augmentation. The proposed system achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling challenging configurations, showcasing its potential for robust and scalable Arabic handwriting recognition.

This system is built purely to decipher the English characters and numbers from images, convert them into text format, and match the existing written scripts or custom keywords provided by the invigilators to check the answers. The Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model fervors and implements an algorithm that is capable of evaluating written scripts based on handwriting and comparing it with the custom keywords provided, whereas the existing models using Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural networks (RNN) suffer from the Vanishing Gradient problem. The core objective of this model is to reduce manual paper checking using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks). It has been implemented more than the models built on conventional approaches in aspects of performance, efficiency, and better text recognition. The inputs given to the model are in the form of custom keywords; the system processes them through HTR and image processing techniques of segmentation; and the output formats the percentage obtained by the student, word error rate, number of words misspelt, synonyms produced, and the effective outcome. The system has the capability to identify and highlight errors made by students. This feature is advantageous for both students and teachers, as it saves a significant amount of time. Even if the keywords used by students do not align perfectly, the advanced processing models employed by the system possess the intelligence to provide a reasonable number of marks.},

   abstract = {Arabic handwritten-text recognition applies an OCR technique and then a text-correction technique to extract the text within an image correctly. Deep learning is a current paradigm utilized in OCR techniques. However, no study investigated or critically analyzed recent deep-learning techniques used for Arabic handwritten OCR and text correction during the period of 2020‚Äì2023. This analysis fills this noticeable gap in the literature, uncovering recent developments and their limitations for researchers, practitioners, and interested readers. The results reveal that CNN-LSTM-CTC is the most suitable architecture among Transformer and GANs for OCR because it is less complex and can hold long textual dependencies. For OCR text correction, applying DL models to generated errors in datasets improved accuracy in many works. In conclusion, Arabic OCR has the potential to further apply several text-embedding models to correct the resultant text from the OCR, and there is a significant gap in studies investigating this problem. In addition, there is a need for more high-quality and domain-specific OCR Arabic handwritten datasets. Moreover, we recommend the practical development of a space for future trends in Arabic OCR applications, derived from current limitations in Arabic OCR works and from applications in other languages; this will involve a plethora of possibilities that have not been effectively researched at the time of writing.},

   abstract = {Recently, deep learning (DL) models, especially those based on long short-term memory (LSTM), have demonstrated their superior ability in resolving sequential data problems. This study investigated the performance of six models that belong to the supervised learning category to evaluate the performance of DL models in terms of streamflow forecasting. They include a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and four LSTM-based models. Two standard models with just one hidden layer-LSTM and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-are used against two more complex models-the stacked LSTM (StackedLSTM) model and the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model. The Red River basin-the largest river basin in the north of Vietnam-was adopted as a case study because of its geographic relevance since Hanoi city-the capital of Vietnam-is located downstream of the Red River. Besides, the input data of these models are the observed data at seven hydrological stations on the three main river branches of the Red River system. This study indicates that the four LSTM-based models exhibited considerably better performance and maintained stability than the FFNN and CNN models. However, the complexity of the StackedLSTM and BiLSTM models is not accompanied by performance improvement because the results of the comparison illustrate that their respective performance is not higher than the two standard models-LSTM and GRU. The findings of this study present that LSTM-based models can reach impressive forecasts even in the presence of upstream dams and reservoirs. For the streamflow-forecasting problem, the LSTM and GRU models with a simple architecture (one hidden layer) are sufficient to produce highly reliable forecasts while minimizing the computation time.},

There are attempts to build captcha detection and classification-based systems using machine learning and neural networks, which need to be tuned for accuracy.

The accuracy of the proposed model is compared with the state-of-the-art models and proves to be effective.

   abstract = {Nowadays, the solution to many practical problems relies on machine learning tools. However, compiling the appropriate training data set for real-world classification problems is challenging because collecting the right amount of data for each class is often difficult or even impossible. In such cases, we can easily face the problem of imbalanced learning. There are many methods in the literature for solving the imbalanced learning problem, so it has become a serious question how to compare the performance of the imbalanced learning methods. Inadequate validation techniques can provide misleading results (e.g., due to data shift), which leads to the development of methods designed for imbalanced data sets, such as stratified cross-validation (SCV) and distribution optimally balanced SCV (DOB-SCV). Previous studies have shown that higher classification performance scores (AUC) can be achieved on imbalanced data sets using DOB-SCV instead of SCV. We investigated the effect of the oversamplers on this difference. The study was conducted on 420 data sets, involving several sampling methods and the DTree, kNN, SVM, and MLP classifiers. We point out that DOB-SCV often provides a little higher F1 and AUC values for classification combined with sampling. However, the results also prove that the selection of the sampler‚Äìclassifier pair is more important for the classification performance than the choice between the DOB-SCV and the SCV techniques.},

The accurate identification of conodonts requires experienced professional researchers. The process is time-consuming and laborious and can be subjective and affected by the professional level and opinions of the appraisers. The problem is exacerbated by the limited number of experts who are qualified to identify conodonts. Therefore, a rapid and simple artificial intelligence method is needed to assist with the identification of conodont species. Although the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for fossil identification has been widely studied, the data used are usually from different families, genera or even higher-level taxonomic units. However, in practical geoscience research, geologists are often more interested in classifying species belonging to the same genus. In this study, we use five fine-grained CNN models on a dataset consisting of nine species of the conodont genus Hindeodus. Based on the cross-validation results, we show that using the Bilinear-ResNet18 model and transfer learning generates the optimal classifier. Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.9 on the test dataset was obtained by the optimal classifier, indicating that the performance of our classifier is satisfactory. In addition, although our study is based on a very limited taxa of conodonts, our research principles and processes can be used as a reference for the automatic identification of other fossils.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it.},

To address class imbalance and improve generalization, the study adopts a holistic training strategy that integrates data augmentation, stratified data splitting, and class weighting, alongside transfer learning. The model is evaluated on the PlantVillage (PV) dataset and a curated Apple PV (APV) dataset and compared against EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B3, Inception-v3, ResNet50, and VGG16 models. The fine-tuned model demonstrates outstanding test accuracies of 99.69% and 99.78% for classifying plant diseases using the APV and PV datasets, respectively. The fine-tuned model outperforms EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B3, and VGG16 on both datasets and shows superior performance compared to Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 on the PV dataset. Both EfficientNet-B0 and the fine-tuned model demonstrate the lowest memory consumption and floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). Also, as compared to the EfficientNet-B0 model, the fine-tuned model achieves an 11% increase in accuracy on the APV dataset and a 49.5% accuracy improvement on the PV dataset, with approximately a 7-8% increase in both memory usage and FLOPs. The fine-tuned model thus emerges as an effective solution for plant leaf disease classification, delivering outstanding accuracy with optimized memory consumption and FLOPs, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This study demonstrates that fine-tuned CNN approaches, when combined with transfer learning, advanced data pre-processing, and architectural optimizations, can significantly enhance the accuracy of diseased leaf classification in crops with efficient implementation in limited-resource settings.},

   abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have transformed the field of computer vision through their exceptional performance in image classification, face recognition, and object detection. Much of its success is due to the development of transfer learning, where pre-trained models trained on large datasets such as ImageNet are fine-tuned (adapted) for new tasks, even when only limited labeled data is available. Fine-tuning involves gradually unfreezing and retraining a pre-trained model to obtain optimal accuracy. However, determining the optimal number of layers to unfreeze remains a critical challenge. Unfreezing too few layers may limit the model's ability to adapt to task-specific features, leading to under-fitting, while fine-tuning too many layers risks over-fitting, thereby compromising generalization on unseen data.},
